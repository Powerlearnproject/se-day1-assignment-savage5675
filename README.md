Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
S/w engineering is the procedural application of principles of engineering in writing instructions, designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software systems.
Importance: ensures efficiency,productivity, reliability and security of software systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Discovery of software engineering(1968) - Nato conferecnce
   this conference shifted software development from ad-hoc process to structured engineering.
   introduced other methodologies like waterfall method that is used in software engineering
2. Rise of object oriented programming (OOP) - 1980s
   this programming made it easier to  maintain, upgrade and scale software.
   also led to mordern frameworks
   simplified complex systems by breaking them down into modular and reusable components.
3. Agile Revoution - 2001
   made development of software more easier and adaptive
   led to the rise of SCRUM, KANBAN, CI/CD practices among many more
   


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
in this phase you identify potential risks and or business idea. estimate the resources needed as well as the total cost needed.
2. Requirement Analysis
in this phase you identify all the resources needed to come up with a succsessfull project.
3. Design
in this phase you come up with a blueprint of how you will like the project to look like.
5. Implementation
in this phase is where the actual coding of the project starts andthe actual project starts coming up.
6. Testing
in this phase you check if the project has any hitches or problems and checking if the intended purpose of the project has been met.
7. Deployment
after testing and finding out that the project has met the intended requirement you now deploy it to the public.
8. Maintenance & Support
   after deploying you now start to maintain the software and ensure frequent updates and provide user support to the public incase they are unable to navigate well in the recent updates made to the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Feature	Waterfall Methodology | 	Agile Methodology 
Approach	Sequential, phase-based process |	Iterative, flexible, and incremental
Structure	Each phase (Planning → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment) must be completed before moving to the next |	Work is divided into small iterations (sprints), allowing continuous development and feedback
Flexibility	Rigid and less adaptable to changes |	Highly flexible and adapts to changing requirements
Customer Involvement	Minimal; feedback is usually at the end |	Continuous customer feedback throughout the process
Timeframe	Longer development cycle; can take months or years |	Shorter cycles (typically 2-4 weeks per sprint)
Testing	Conducted after development is complete |	Continuous testing throughout development
Risk Handling	High risk; errors detected late can be costly to fix |	Low risk; early detection of issues allows quick fixes


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - designs, writes and  maintans the lines of code used to build the software application.
QUALITY assurance Engineer - ensures that the software that has been designed meets all the requirements and standards that have been set before being deployed to the public.
Project Manager - oversees the software development process, ensuring timely delivery and full alignment with the intended goal of the business.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE -
  They boost productivity by having features like aout-completion
  simplifies debugging by having built-in debuggers
  Supports multipple programming languages and frameworks. 
  Example: VS code, Pycharm, eclipse.
VCS - 
   Facilitate code tracking
   Enhances team collaborations
   Improves code quality and security
   Example: Apache subversion, Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 1. Debugging and fixing errors in lines of code.
    Solution: Use of debbuging tools like DevTools among many more
 2. Managing Changing requirements.
    Solution: use of Aile methodology here will be of great help to help deal wit the frequent changes in the requirements.
 3. Security Threats.
    Solution: Use of encryption and following security guidelins to prevent security breaches.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit Testing - testing components or functions of a program in isolation.
    importance: Prevents small errors from escalating into larger issues
  Integration Testing - you check on how differnt components and modules interact with one another.
    importance: Ensures modules function correctly when combined.
  System Testing - checking the intergrated system to ensure that it meets the set standards.
    importance: Ensures the entire system is stable and ready for deployment.
  Acceptance Testing - Testing to determine whether the software meets business and user requirements
    importance: Ensures the software is ready for real users and meets business needs.





#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 is the practice of designing and refining inputs to optimize responses from AI Models.
 importance: enhances efficiency and productivity as well as AI Output quality


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt - explain drugs
Improved - Explain the impact of drug abuse among the youths 
Explanation - the improved prompt makes it clear on what response we would love to get, that is, the impact of abuse of drugs on he target audience.
